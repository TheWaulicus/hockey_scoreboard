# Hockey Scoreboard

A modern, responsive hockey scoreboard web app. No dependenciesâ€”just open in your browser.

## Files

- `index.html`: Main HTML file. References external CSS and JS.
- `scoreboard.css`: All styles for layout, grid, modal, and responsive design.
- `scoreboard.js`: All logic for timer, period, scores, shots, team/league names and logos, settings modal, and penalties.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Edit league and team names by clicking the settings button (top right).
3. Upload logos for league and teams in the settings modal.
4. Use + and - buttons to increment/decrement scores and shots for each team.
5. Add penalties for each team, set player number and minutes, and control timers.
6. All changes are in-memory (refreshing resets the scoreboard).

## Development

- All code is modular and split for maintainability.
- To change styles, edit `scoreboard.css`.
